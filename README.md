# Ark Beat
A rhythm game written in masm.
A fan work following Muse Dash and Arknights. Thanks for their inspiration.
Once a homework, but now a mastarwork (at least for s.b.).

# Skadi's workshop
A beat generator to generate .ark files.
Yes, you have to make generation through **tapping by hand** lol.

More instructions in the near future. (maybe never)
